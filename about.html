        <h3>Overview of the Iban Ethnic Group:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Iban, traditionally known as Sea Dayaks, are one of the most populous and significant indigenous groups in Sarawak, Malaysia. This ethnic group has a rich cultural heritage and has played a crucial role in the history and development of the region.</li>
            <li>The Iban predominantly settle along Sarawak's major rivers, such as the Rajang, Batang Ai, and Baram rivers. These rivers are vital for their daily lives, providing water for drinking, cooking, and agriculture, as well as serving as transportation routes. The fertile riverbanks offer ideal conditions for their traditional farming practices.</li>
            <li>Historically, the Iban were known for their headhunting practices, which were integral to their warfare and spiritual rituals. Headhunting was believed to bring spiritual benefits and was a way to honor their ancestors. It also played a role in asserting dominance and deterring enemy tribes. Though headhunting is no longer practiced, it remains a significant part of their cultural identity and history.</li>
            <li>The Iban are renowned for their exceptional craftsmanship, particularly in weaving and woodcarving. Their traditional textiles, known as pua kumbu, are intricately woven with symbolic designs and are highly valued. Woodcarving is another significant skill, with carvings often depicting spiritual symbols and stories from their folklore. These crafts are not only artistic expressions but also hold cultural and spiritual significance.</li>
            <li>Iban society is organized around communal living in longhouses, known locally as rumah panjai. These longhouses are large, shared dwellings that accommodate multiple families. Each family has its own apartment-like space, while common areas are shared by all residents. This communal living fosters a strong sense of community, collective identity, and mutual support among the Iban people. The longhouse is more than a residence; it is the center of social, cultural, and political life.</li>

        <h3>Historical Background and Migration to Sarawak:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The migration and settlement of the Iban people in Sarawak is a tale of resilience, adaptation, and cultural preservation.</li>
            <li>The Iban are believed to have migrated from the Kapuas River basin in Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, to Sarawak over several centuries. Significant migrations occurred around the 15th century. This migration was motivated by the search for fertile land suitable for their traditional shifting cultivation (paddy farming) and to escape conflicts and pressures from other ethnic groups in their original areas.</li>
            <li>The migration was driven by the need to find new farming lands and the allure of fertile river valleys. The Iban practiced shifting cultivation, which requires large areas of land to rotate crops and maintain soil fertility. Additionally, the Iban sought to escape conflicts with other groups in Kalimantan, seeking a more peaceful and prosperous life in Sarawak.</li>
            <li>Upon arriving in Sarawak, the Iban established settlements along the major rivers. Rivers were essential for transportation, agriculture, and daily living. The fertile riverbanks provided ideal conditions for their traditional farming practices. Over time, the Iban adapted to the local environment, forming harmonious relationships with other indigenous and non-indigenous groups. This interaction led to a cultural exchange, influencing and being influenced by other communities.</li>
