    <h3>Traditional Iban Society</h3>

    <h4>Social Structure and Hierarchy</h4>

    <p>The traditional Iban social structure is deeply rooted in the longhouse community, which serves as the fundamental unit of Iban society. This structure is not only a reflection of their way of life but also a crucial aspect of their cultural identity.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Longhouse Community:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Iban live in communal longhouses, known as <em>rumah panjai</em>. Each longhouse functions as a single extended family, with multiple nuclear families residing under one roof. This communal living fosters a strong sense of unity, cooperation, and mutual support among the Iban people. The longhouse is both a physical structure and a symbol of social and cultural cohesion.</li>
                <li>The layout of a longhouse typically includes individual family rooms (bilik) along a central corridor (ruai), where communal activities take place. The <em>ruai</em> serves as the social and ceremonial space, hosting gatherings, festivals, and daily interactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Tuai Rumah (Headman):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The tuai rumah is the head of the longhouse and plays a pivotal role in the community. This position is usually held by a respected elder who is responsible for the overall administration of the longhouse. The tuai rumahâ€™s duties include:</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> The tuai rumah acts as a mediator in disputes within the community, ensuring harmony and adherence to customary laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual Leadership:</strong> The headman leads important rituals and ceremonies, which are integral to the Iban's spiritual life and cultural traditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Custodian of Adat:</strong> The tuai rumah maintains and enforces <em>adat</em> (customary laws), which govern the social and moral conduct of the community. These laws cover various aspects of life, from marriage and inheritance to agricultural practices and social behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Social Roles and Responsibilities:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Iban social hierarchy includes a variety of roles, each contributing to the community's welfare and cultural preservation:</li>
                <li><strong>Warriors (Pengayau):</strong> Historically, Iban warriors were esteemed for their bravery in headhunting raids, which were believed to bring spiritual benefits and honor to their families. Although headhunting is no longer practiced, the valor of warriors is still celebrated in Iban folklore and rituals.</li>
                <li><strong>Hunters:</strong> Skilled in tracking and hunting wildlife, hunters provide essential protein for the community and participate in rituals that honor the spirits of the forest and animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Farmers:</strong> Agriculture, particularly shifting cultivation (paddy farming), is the backbone of Iban subsistence. Farmers are responsible for planting, harvesting, and maintaining rice fields, which are central to Iban life and cultural festivals like Gawai Dayak.</li>
                <li><strong>Craftsmen:</strong> Renowned for their craftsmanship, Iban artisans create intricate weavings, woodcarvings, and beadwork. These crafts are not only functional but also carry deep cultural and spiritual significance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Leadership and Merit:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Leadership roles within the Iban community are often hereditary, passed down through generations within a family line. However, individual merit also plays a significant role in leadership selection. Attributes such as bravery in warfare, wisdom in decision-making, and the ability to maintain social harmony can elevate an individual to a leadership position, regardless of lineage.</li>
                <li>This blend of hereditary and merit-based leadership ensures that the most capable individuals guide the community, preserving traditional values while adapting to changing circumstances.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, the traditional Iban society is a well-structured and cohesive community centered around the longhouse and guided by the tuai rumah. The intricate social hierarchy, with its various roles and responsibilities, reflects the Iban's commitment to communal living, cultural preservation, and adaptability.</p>
